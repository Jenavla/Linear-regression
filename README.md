# Linear Regression with Outlier Detection
This repository contains a Python script for performing linear regression on a dataset, along with outlier detection using Z-scores. The script uses the scikit-learn library for machine learning and visualization tools such as matplotlib and seaborn.

# Usage
Prerequisites
Python (>=3.6)
Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy

# Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Adjust the script according to your needs. You can modify the following parameters in the script to work with your specific dataset:
data - Load your dataset using pandas, specifying the file path and separator.
target_col - Set the target variable (the variable you want to predict).
feature_cols - Define the feature columns you want to use for prediction.
test_size - Specify the test size for train-test split.
zscore_threshold - Set the Z-score threshold for outlier detection.
3. Run the script
4. The script will perform linear regression, detect outliers using Z-scores, plot feature vs. prediction, and provide evaluation metrics.
5. Review the results and visualization to analyze the model's performance.

# Customization
Feel free to customize the script by adjusting the parameters mentioned above to fit your specific dataset and problem. You can change the feature columns, target variable, test size, and outlier detection threshold as needed.
